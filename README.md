# CodeAlpha Credit Scoring Model

ðŸŽ¯ This project is part of my CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship, where I built a system to predict an individual's creditworthiness using machine learning.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights:
- Predicted the likelihood of credit default using classification models
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluated models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualized the most influential financial features

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset:
UCI Credit Card Default Dataset

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“Œ Results:
- Achieved ROC-AUC of 0.75+
- Identified key features influencing credit default risk

---

## ðŸ’¼ Internship Details:
This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha.
